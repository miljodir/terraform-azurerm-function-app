# Azure Function App
This repo is forked from claranet/terraform-azurerm-function-app and modified towards meeting Milj√∏direktoratet's needs.
Main differences per December 2023 are support for private endpoints / non-public network access and removing diagnostic settings which are set up by other means.

This Terraform module creates an [Azure Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)
with its [App Service Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans),
a B1 Linux plan by default.
A [Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/) and an [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
are required and are created if not provided.
This module allows to deploy a application from a local or remote ZIP file that will be stored on the associated storage
account.

You can create an Azure Function without plan by using the submodule `modules/functionapp`.
